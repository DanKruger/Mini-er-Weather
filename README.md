# Mini-er Weather

This is a weather app.

## Currently

    - you have to enter your location manually but I will add gps location functionality at some point
    - you will have to grab your own api key from weatherapi.com and add it to your .env to run this app
        name your api key `REACT_APP_API_KEY`
